    summary: |
      Hello!
      I am Soyeong Jeong, a **Ph.D. student** at the <a href="https://www.mlai-kaist.com/">MLAI Lab</a> at KAIST.
      My research interests are mainly on **information retrieval** for solving **open domain language tasks** and interpretation of **large language models** for making them interpretable when deployed on real-world applications. Not limited to, I am interested in broad topics on natural language understanding.
